*realmlisto* is an utility tool for those who love playing on different WoW private servers.  
Manage your realmlists without any copy/paste hassle and easily start your client from the app.

> *realmlisto*'s `play` feature is compatible with every expansion up to *Cataclysm* (included). If the following expansions have the same folder structure as the olders, then it'll work for them too.

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
